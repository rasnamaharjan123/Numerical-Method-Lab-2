1. Lagrange's Interpolation
Speed:

Pros: Simple and does not require solving linear systems.

Cons: Computationally expensive for higher order polynomials as it involves nested loops to compute the interpolating polynomial.

Accuracy:

Pros: Good for small number of data points.

Cons: Sensitive to large data sets and can exhibit significant oscillations (Runge's phenomenon).

Ease of Coding:

Pros: Straightforward implementation using basic loops.

Cons: Less efficient for large datasets due to its O(n^2) complexity.

2. Newton's Forward Difference Interpolation
Speed:

Pros: Efficient for adding new data points, as it builds on previously computed differences.

Cons: Suitable for equally spaced data points; less efficient for irregular spacing.

Accuracy:

Pros: Accurate for a moderate number of equally spaced data points.

Cons: Accuracy reduces for irregularly spaced data points or when extrapolating.

Ease of Coding:

Pros: Easy to code using loops and basic arithmetic operations.

Cons: Involves managing forward difference tables, which can be cumbersome for very large datasets.

3. Newton's Backward Difference Interpolation
Speed:

Pros: Similar to forward difference interpolation in terms of efficiency.

Cons: Specifically useful for interpolating values near the end of the data set.

Accuracy:

Pros: Accurate for a moderate number of equally spaced data points near the end of the data set.

Cons: Similar accuracy constraints as forward difference interpolation.

Ease of Coding:

Pros: Similar ease of implementation as forward difference.

Cons: Requires backward difference table management, which can be a bit tricky.

4. Newton's Central Divided Difference Interpolation
Speed:

Pros: Efficient for data points centered around the interpolation point.

Cons: Less efficient for data points far from the center.

Accuracy:

Pros: Generally provides better accuracy for equally spaced points around the interpolation point.

Cons: Accuracy diminishes for points near the ends of the interval or with irregular spacing.

Ease of Coding:

Pros: A bit more complex than forward/backward difference but manageable.

Cons: Requires careful management of divided difference tables.

5. Cubic Spline Interpolation
Speed:

Pros: Requires solving a tridiagonal system of equations, which is efficient (O(n) complexity).

Cons: Slightly more computational overhead compared to polynomial interpolations.

Accuracy:

Pros: Very accurate for smooth curves and avoids oscillations seen in higher-degree polynomial interpolations.

Cons: Can be overkill for small datasets or when exact interpolation is not necessary.

Ease of Coding:

Pros: More complex to implement due to the need for solving linear systems and managing boundary conditions.

Cons: Requires careful coding and understanding of spline theory.
